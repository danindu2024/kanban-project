# Changelog

All notable changes to the FlowState project documentation and implementation.

## [Sprint 1] - 2025-12-31

### Security Enhancements
- **Email Validation:** Upgraded regex to RFC-compliant pattern
- **JWT Secret:** Added minimum 32-character length validation at startup
- **Token Error Handling:** Differentiate between expired (AUTH_002) and invalid (AUTH_003) tokens
- **Logging Protection:** Excluded `/auth/*` routes from Morgan request logging

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `SECURITY.md` to reflect actual token storage strategy (memory, not HTTP-Only cookies)
- Added "Known Security Limitations" section documenting Sprint 1 trade-offs
- Expanded `API_SPECIFICATION.md` with complete `/auth/me` endpoint documentation
- Added USER_001 and USER_002 error codes to API specification
- Updated `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` with validation rules and security constraints

### Known Issues (Deferred to Sprint 2)
- Race condition in user registration (MongoDB handles via unique index)
- No input sanitization (React JSX escaping provides baseline protection)
- No password complexity requirements (intentional for MVP)

### Architecture Decisions
- Chose JWT-in-JSON-body over HTTP-Only cookies for Sprint 1 simplicity
- Accepted "last write wins" for concurrent operations (no conflict resolution)
- Deferred refresh token implementation to Sprint 2
